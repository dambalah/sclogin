This is a sample application that was built to play around with statecharts in Sproutcore, as well as custom views.

It has one dependency: [Ki](http://github.com/FrozenCanuck/Ki)

#Getting Started

To get started, you need to clone this project and then add Ki as a framework.

    $ git clone git@github.com:dambalah/sclogin.git sclogin
    $ cd sclogin
    $ cd frameworks
    $ git clone git://github.com/FrozenCanuck/Ki.git ki
    
Congrats! You can now start the application and see how it works:

     sc-server
     
Then, browse to [http://0.0.0.0:4020/login](http://0.0.0.0:4020/login)
